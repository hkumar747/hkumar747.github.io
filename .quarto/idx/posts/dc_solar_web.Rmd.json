[(Frontier Group, 2022)](https://frontiergroup.org/resources/shining-cities-2022/)\n\nThe most likely reason behind this boost was DC's **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)** policies.\nRPS policies are regulatory mandates to increase the production of energy from renewable sources, requiring electric utilities to \nensure that a specified percentage of the energy they generate or sell comes from renewable sources by a certain date.\nDespite the lack of a comprehensive federal RPS, state-level mandates have collectively contributed to a significant increase \nin the country's renewable energy capacity, transforming the energy landscape and paving the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nDC's RPS is one of the country's most ambitious, as underscored by the **Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018.**\nThis act mandates that 100 percent of the District’s electric supply be sourced from renewable generators by 2032. Additionally, \nit sets forth a solar \"carve-out\" requirement that 5.5 percent of the 2032 electric supply must come from in-District solar, with this percentage increasing\nto 10 percent by 2041. This places the District as the third jurisdiction in the U.S., following Hawai'i and California, to\nestablish a 100 percent renewable energy requirement.\n\nThe primary mechanism by which the DC Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) influences the solar market is through **Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)**\nand **Alternative Compliance Payments (ACP).** \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### SRECs and ACP\n- **SREC:** Market-based instruments that represent the environmental benefits of generating solar power. \nEach SREC certifies that one megawatt-hour of solar electricity has been generated and can be sold or traded, providing an additional revenue stream for solar energy producers on top of the electricity they sell.\n\n- **ACP:** Penalties that electric utilities or other entities must pay if they fail to meet their renewable energy targets, specifically the portion of those targets that must be met through solar energy. \n:::\n\nThere have been several major policy changes in DC that affect solar adoption incentives, as summarized in this RPS report\n by the DC Public Service Commission (https://dcpsc.org/Orders-and-Regulations/PSC-Reports-to-the-DC-Council/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard.aspx)\n\n\n-\t**Distributed Generation Amendment Act, 2011**\n    -\tAmended RPS to increase solar requirements through 2023 to 2.5%.\n    - Restricted eligible solar energy resources to those within the District or connected to a feeder serving the District.\n\n- **Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act, 2016**\n    - Increased RPS requirement to 50% by 2032, with solar energy requirement rising to 5%.\n    - Modified solar energy RPS compliance fees, setting new rates from 2016 through 2032.\n\n- **CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act, 2018**\n    - Raised RPS to 100% by 2032, with solar energy requirement increasing to 5.5% by 2032 and 10% by 2041.\n    - Extended solar REC banking period from three to five years.\n\n- **Local Solar Expansion Amendment Act, 2022**\n\n    - Increased solar RPS requirement to 15% by 2041.\n    - Directed funds from alternative compliance payments to support low-income ratepayer relief and solar policy studies.\n    - Adjusted solar energy RPS compliance fees, gradually reducing them from 2024 through 2033, setting a fee of $0.30 per kWh from 2033 through 2041, and $0.10 thereafter.\n\n```{r, include=FALSE}\n\n# inset chatCompletion\n# Create the data frame\nyear <- 2011:2041\ntier_one_renewable_percent <- c(4, 5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, 11.5, 13.5, 15.5, 17.5, 20, 26.25, 32.5, 38.75, 45.0, 52.0, 59.0, 66.0, 73.0, 80.0, 87.0, 94.0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100)\nsolar_energy <- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.825, 0.98, 1.15, 1.85, 2.175, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.65, 4.3, 5.0, 5.65, 6.3, 7.0, 7.65, 8.3, 9.0, 9.65, 10.3, 11.0, 11.65, 12.3, 13.0, 13.65, 14.3, 15.0)\n\ndata <- data.frame(year, tier_one_renewable_percent, solar_energy)\n\ndata$gap <- data$tier_one_renewable_percent-data$solar_energy\n\n# Assuming 'data' is your dataframe\n# Add a new column for the act labels\ndata$Act <- NA  # Initialize with NA\ndata$Act[data$year == 2011] <- \"Distributed Generation Amendment Act of 2011\"\ndata$Act[data$year == 2016] <- \"Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act\"\ndata$Act[data$year == 2022] <- \"Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act\"\n\n# Now, plotting with enhancements and adding specific labels\np <- ggplot(data, aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent, color = \"Tier-One Renewable Percent\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_area(aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent), fill = \"skyblue\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = solar_energy, color = \"Solar Energy\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_area(aes(y = solar_energy), fill = \"yellow\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent), color = \"#0099f9\", size = 2) +\n  geom_label(data = data %>% filter(!is.na(Act)), aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent, label = Act), nudge_x = 0.25, nudge_y = 0.25, check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, label.size = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Tier-One Renewable Percent\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Solar Energy\" = \"yellow\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Percent / Energy\", title = \"Tier-One Renewable Percent and Solar Energy Over Time\", color = \"Metrics\") +\n   xlim(2010, 2032) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10))\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Installed solar capacity has skyrocketed in DC. \n\nExisting empirical evidence finds that US states that closed off their SREC markets to out-of-state facilites witnessed higher\nsolar installation, as DC did in 2011.

([EIA 2022](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/))\n\n\"The total number of SRECs retired for compliance was 263,919, which is equivalent to nearly 264,000 MWh and \nrepresents about 2.6% of the total retail electricity sales for the year\"​​. [(DC Public Service Commission, 2023)](https://dcpsc.org/Utility-Information/Electric/RPS/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard-Program/Monthly-Update-of-Solar-Generator-Certification.aspx_)\nOf course, SRECs can be held before they are cashed - it indicates that by this date, there has been *at least* 264,000 MWh generation of solar. \n\n\n## The DC Solar Market - Incentives and Costs\n\nIn Washington DC, the average solar panel costs [$11,000-$14,000](https://www.solarreviews.com/solar-panels/district-of-columbia) after federal incentives\n\nA household in DC can factor in three types of incentives available for a solar installation :\n\n- Federal rebates\n\n- SREC prices\n\n- Net metering\n\nThere is another type of indirect incentive, which might function as a 'stick' to the above 'carrots'. \nThis is the [**Building Energy Benchmarking Policy (BEPS)**](https://doee.dc.gov/service/building-energy-performance-standards-beps), which aims to identify and impose financial penalties on large buildings (>10,000 sq feet) with greater than average energy consumption\n\nThe following figures describe the outlook for solar generation in the District:\n\n- Technical potential = 1200 MW\n- Target by 2040 = 665 MW\n- Adoption in 2023 = 201 MW\n\nThe above figures are from a report by [Synapse Energy Economics](https://www.synapse-energy.com/sites/default/files/OPCs-Study-on-Future-of-Solar-PV-in-the-District-of-Columbia-18-077.pdf), where it also lays out the factors holding back adoption in DC.\nFor now, we zoom in on one particular factor laid out in the report:\n\n\"Given that **60 percent of households in the District are renter-occupied**, home ownership and upfront costs are likely strong barriers to solar adoption\"\n\n\n## Creating a building-level dataset to examine solar adoption\n\nWith the help of DC Open Data’s frequently updated and granular data on buildings, we can merge data solar and building attributes data\nfor almost all of DC’s >100,000 residential buildings. \n\n - [DC PSC Monthly Update of Solar generator certification](https://dcpsc.org/Utility-Information/Electric/RPS/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard-Program/Monthly-Update-of-Solar-Generator-Certification.aspx_)\n   Geocoded dataset of all approved solar panels in Washington DC.\n\n - [Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA)](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c5fb3fbe4c694a59a6eef7bf5f8bc49a)\n   \n   Building attributes, sourced from tax records properties in Washington, D.C.

Statistical approaches\n\n\nThe variables must account for these factors:\n\n- Spatial similarity or diffusion frameworks\n\n- Potential generation (revealed by the Google Solar API)\n\n- Actual energy use: This is the most difficult to get. Closest we can get is energy expenditures, and that only exists.\n\nTechniques:\n\n1. OLS and panel regressions\n2. Spatial regression models\n3. Tree-based estimation (XGBoost)\n4. Graph learning\n\nSynapse Inc.(2020) mentions that the high percentage of renters in the district means the incentive for households to spend on solar installation is low.\n\nAs a warm-up empirical test, let's test this out using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2020?\n\n### Example: Using Census data to check the relation between home-ownership and solar capacity added\n\nIdeally, we would have joined building-level data of owner vs renter occupation, but in its absence, we can use **block-group** level data\nfrom the ACS 2019 on homeownership rates.

[(Frontier Group, 2022)](https://frontiergroup.org/resources/shining-cities-2022/)\n\nThe most likely reason behind this boost was DC's **Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS)** policies.\nRPS policies are regulatory mandates to increase the production of energy from renewable sources, requiring electric utilities to \nensure that a specified percentage of the energy they generate or sell comes from renewable sources by a certain date.\nDespite the lack of a comprehensive federal RPS, state-level mandates have collectively contributed to a significant increase \nin the country's renewable energy capacity, transforming the energy landscape and paving the way for a more sustainable future.\n\nDC's RPS is one of the country's most ambitious, as underscored by the **Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018.**\nThis act mandates that 100 percent of the District’s electric supply be sourced from renewable generators by 2032. Additionally, \nit sets forth a solar \"carve-out\" requirement that 5.5 percent of the 2032 electric supply must come from in-District solar, with this percentage increasing\nto 10 percent by 2041. This places the District as the third jurisdiction in the U.S., following Hawai'i and California, to\nestablish a 100 percent renewable energy requirement.\n\nThe primary mechanism by which the DC Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) influences the solar market is through **Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)**\nand **Alternative Compliance Payments (ACP).** \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n### SRECs and ACP\n- **SREC:** Market-based instruments that represent the environmental benefits of generating solar power. \nEach SREC certifies that one megawatt-hour of solar electricity has been generated and can be sold or traded, providing an additional revenue stream for solar energy producers on top of the electricity they sell.\n\n- **ACP:** Penalties that electric utilities or other entities must pay if they fail to meet their renewable energy targets, specifically the portion of those targets that must be met through solar energy. \n:::\n\nThere have been several major policy changes in DC that affect solar adoption incentives, as summarized in this RPS report\n by the DC Public Service Commission (https://dcpsc.org/Orders-and-Regulations/PSC-Reports-to-the-DC-Council/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard.aspx)\n\n\n-\t**Distributed Generation Amendment Act, 2011**\n    -\tAmended RPS to increase solar requirements through 2023 to 2.5%.\n    - Restricted eligible solar energy resources to those within the District or connected to a feeder serving the District.\n\n- **Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act, 2016**\n    - Increased RPS requirement to 50% by 2032, with solar energy requirement rising to 5%.\n    - Modified solar energy RPS compliance fees, setting new rates from 2016 through 2032.\n\n- **CleanEnergy DC Omnibus Amendment Act, 2018**\n    - Raised RPS to 100% by 2032, with solar energy requirement increasing to 5.5% by 2032 and 10% by 2041.\n    - Extended solar REC banking period from three to five years.\n\n- **Local Solar Expansion Amendment Act, 2022**\n\n    - Increased solar RPS requirement to 15% by 2041.\n    - Directed funds from alternative compliance payments to support low-income ratepayer relief and solar policy studies.\n    - Adjusted solar energy RPS compliance fees, gradually reducing them from 2024 through 2033, setting a fee of $0.30 per kWh from 2033 through 2041, and $0.10 thereafter.\n\n```{r, include=FALSE}\n\n# inset chatCompletion\n# Create the data frame\nyear <- 2011:2041\ntier_one_renewable_percent <- c(4, 5, 6.5, 8, 9.5, 11.5, 13.5, 15.5, 17.5, 20, 26.25, 32.5, 38.75, 45.0, 52.0, 59.0, 66.0, 73.0, 80.0, 87.0, 94.0, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100)\nsolar_energy <- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.825, 0.98, 1.15, 1.85, 2.175, 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 3.65, 4.3, 5.0, 5.65, 6.3, 7.0, 7.65, 8.3, 9.0, 9.65, 10.3, 11.0, 11.65, 12.3, 13.0, 13.65, 14.3, 15.0)\n\ndata <- data.frame(year, tier_one_renewable_percent, solar_energy)\n\ndata$gap <- data$tier_one_renewable_percent-data$solar_energy\n\n# Assuming 'data' is your dataframe\n# Add a new column for the act labels\ndata$Act <- NA  # Initialize with NA\ndata$Act[data$year == 2011] <- \"Distributed Generation Amendment Act of 2011\"\ndata$Act[data$year == 2016] <- \"Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act\"\ndata$Act[data$year == 2022] <- \"Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act\"\n\n# Now, plotting with enhancements and adding specific labels\np <- ggplot(data, aes(x = year)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent, color = \"Tier-One Renewable Percent\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_area(aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent), fill = \"skyblue\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = solar_energy, color = \"Solar Energy\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_area(aes(y = solar_energy), fill = \"yellow\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent), color = \"#0099f9\", size = 2) +\n  geom_label(data = data %>% filter(!is.na(Act)), aes(y = tier_one_renewable_percent, label = Act), nudge_x = 0.25, nudge_y = 0.25, check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, label.size = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Tier-One Renewable Percent\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Solar Energy\" = \"yellow\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Percent / Energy\", title = \"Tier-One Renewable Percent and Solar Energy Over Time\", color = \"Metrics\") +\n   xlim(2010, 2032) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n        plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10))\n\n# Print the plot\nprint(p)\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Installed solar capacity has skyrocketed in DC. \n\nExisting empirical evidence finds that US states that closed off their SREC markets to out-of-state facilites witnessed higher\nsolar installation, as DC did in 2011.

([EIA 2022](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/state/))\n\n\"The total number of SRECs retired for compliance was 263,919, which is equivalent to nearly 264,000 MWh and \nrepresents about 2.6% of the total retail electricity sales for the year\"​​.

(This is a transformed variable)\n\nThe above example illustrates the fundamental prediction problem facing us - will these buildings adopt?\n\nThey seem to be as suitable as the buildings in the bottom 3 rows, receiving high amounts of annual sunlight (from the supply side).\n\n\n\nThe fact that the solar data has both the exact location and date of solar panel installation, added with DC Open Data's rich repository\nof spatial building-level datasets implies that we can drill down at the hyperlocal level for insights in solar adoption patterns.\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\nward_data <- readRDS(\"data/ward_solar.rds\")\nzip_data <- readRDS(\"data/zipcode_solar.rds\")\nsolar_build <- readRDS(\"data/solar_build.rds\")\n\n# Check the spatial level and generate the map accordingly\npal <- colorNumeric(palette = \"YlOrRd\", domain = data$total_capacity_mw)\n  \n# map <- leaflet(zip_data) %>%\n#     addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%\n#     addPolygons(\n#       layerId = ~NAME,\n#       fillColor = ~pal(total_capacity_mw),\n#       color = \"#444444\",\n#       weight = 1,\n#       smoothFactor = 0.5,\n#       popup = ~paste(\"Zip/Ward:\", NAME,\n#                      \"<br>Total Capacity MW:\", total_capacity_mw,\n#                      \"<br>Percentage Solar:\", perc_solar),\n#       highlightOptions = highlightOptions(weight = 2, \n#                                           color = \"white\",\n#                                           bringToFront = TRUE))\n\n# print(map)\n\n########################################################3\n## building\n\nspatialLevel <- \"build\" # or \"zipcode\"\n# Calculate quantiles for `Capacity (MW)`\nsolar_build$`Capacity (KW)` <- solar_build$`Capacity (MW)`*1000\nquantiles <- quantile(solar_build$`Capacity (KW)`, probs = c(0.01, 0.95))\n\n# Use the quantiles to set the domain for colorNumeric\npal <- colorNumeric(palette = \"YlOrRd\", domain = c(quantiles[1], quantiles[2]))\n\n# Generate the map with adjusted zoom level and quantile-based color scaling\nmap <- leaflet(solar_build) %>%\n    addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%\n    addPolygons(\n      layerId = ~Number,\n      fillColor = ~pal(`Capacity (KW)`),\n      color = \"#444444\",\n      weight = 1,\n      smoothFactor = 0.5,\n      popup = ~paste(\"Address:\", `Facility Address`,\n                     \"<br>Total Capacity (KW):\", `Capacity (KW)`\n                     ),\n      highlightOptions = highlightOptions(weight = 2, color = \"white\", bringToFront = TRUE)\n    ) %>%\n    setView(lng = -77.04026, lat = 38.93215, zoom = 16) # Adjusted zoom level\n\n# Add a mini-map with the specified position\nmap %>% addMiniMap(tiles = providers$CartoDB.Positron,\n                   toggleDisplay = TRUE,\n                   position = \"bottomright\")\n\n# <iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"yes\" src=\"https://hk939.shinyapps.io/dc_solar_shiny_fnl/\"> </iframe>\n\nprint(map)\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Modeling paradigms for solar adoption:\n\nNow that the data is consolidated, the next task is to model its diffusion process, and forecast it into the future.\n\nA popular approach is NREL's Distributed Renewable Generation model (`dGen`) model.\n\n\nIn a review of around 200 papers, Alipour et al (2021) found the types of modeling approaches:\n\n- **Qualitative: 8.2%**\n\n- **Statistical analysis : 56.7%**\n\n- **Simulation-based (ABMs, spatial, diffusion): 35.1%**\n\n\n### 1. Statistical approaches\n\n\nThe variables must account for these factors:\n\n- Spatial similarity or diffusion frameworks\n\n- Potential generation (revealed by the Google Solar API)\n\n- Actual energy use: This is the most difficult to get. Closest we can get is energy expenditures, and that only exists.\n\nTechniques:\n\n1. OLS and panel regressions\n2. Spatial regression models\n3. Tree-based estimation (XGBoost)\n4. Graph learning\n\nSynapse Inc.(2020) mentions that the high percentage of renters in the district means the incentive for households to spend on solar installation is low.\n\nAs a warm-up empirical test, let's test this out using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2020?\n\n### Example: Using Census data to check the relation between home-ownership and solar capacity added\n\nIdeally, we would have joined building-level data of owner vs renter occupation, but in its absence, we can use **block-group** level data\nfrom the ACS 2019 on homeownership rates. What does the ACS 2019 show about the characteristics of high-solar adoption areas?\n\n\n**Sample code: `tidyCensus`**\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}\n#| code-fold: true\n#| code-summary: \"Sample `tidyCensus` code\"\n\nst_acs <- get_acs(variables = c(total_pop = \"B02001_001E\", \n                                  owner_occupied = \"B25003_002E\",\n                                  total_occupied = \"B25003_001E\"),\n                    geography = \"block group\",\n                    geometry = TRUE,\n                    state = \"DC\", \n                    year = 2019) \n```\n\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}\n\nbg_df <- st_read(\"data/solar_acs2019_bg.geojson\")\n\n# Perform a spatial join: add data from bg_df to df_sample based on their spatial relationship\n# zip_data <- zip_data %>%  st_make_valid()\n# joined_sf <- st_join(zip_data, bg_df, join = st_contains)\n\n# Improved plot for polygon sf object\n# basic_plot <- ggplot(data = bg_df) +\n#   geom_sf(aes(fill = total_capacity), color = \"black\", size = 0.2) +  # Fill polygons and add borders\n#   scale_fill_viridis(option = \"C\", direction = -1) +  # Viridis color scale\n#   labs(\n#     title = \"Per Capita Solar Capacity\",\n#     fill = \"Per Capita kW\",\n#     caption = \"Data Source: ACS 2019, DCPSC 2023\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal() +\n#   theme(\n#     legend.position = \"right\",\n#     plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),  # Center the plot title\n#     plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8)  # Align caption\n#   )\n# \n# basic_plot\n# \n# model_1 <- lm(pc_capkw ~ own_rate, data = bg_df)\n# # Calculate robust standard errors\n# # robust_se1 <- vcovHC(model_1, type = \"HC1\")\n# # robust_se1 <- as.vector(coeftest(model_1, vcovHC(model_1, type = \"HC1\"))[, \"Std.

Agent based models: NREL dGen \n\nThe National Renewable Energy Lab's [Distributed Generation Market Demand (dGen)](https://github.com/NREL/dgen?tab=readme-ov-file) model is defined as:\n>\n \"Statistically representative residential and commercial agents are ingested by the model and used to forecast PV adoption based on user specified configurations like electricity rate prices, electricity load growth, solar resource factors, and much more.\"\n>\n\nAlipour et al (2021) describe \n> \nself-governing households at the bottom of a social\n phenomenon where each decides heterogeneously and heuristi\ncally over time and space, but their aggregated decisions produce\n macro outcomes \n>\n\nThe model is available open-source on Github (linked above) as a deployable docker container on Github. \n\nDo we use the model off the shelf, or do we tweak and adapt it to our case?
