    "text": "As of 2022, solar energy provided about 3.4% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2024) Among US cities, Honolulu tops the chart, with per capita solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity installed at 1133 Watts DC/person in 2022. Washington DC was at 10th rank by 2022 (leaping up from 17th in 2018.) (Frontier Group, 2022)\nThe most likely reason behind this boost was DC’s Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies. RPS policies are regulatory mandates to increase the production of energy from renewable sources, requiring electric utilities to ensure that a specified percentage of the energy they generate or sell comes from renewable sources by a certain date. Despite the lack of a comprehensive federal RPS, state-level mandates have collectively contributed to a significant increase in the country’s renewable energy capacity, transforming the energy landscape and paving the way for a more sustainable future.\nDC’s RPS is one of the country’s most ambitious, as underscored by the Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018. This act mandates that 100 percent of the District’s electric supply be sourced from renewable generators by 2032. Additionally, it sets forth a solar “carve-out” requirement that 5.5 percent of the 2032 electric supply must come from in-District solar, with this percentage increasing to 10 percent by 2041. This places the District as the third jurisdiction in the U.S., following Hawai’i and California, to establish a 100 percent renewable energy requirement.\nThe primary mechanism by which the DC Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) influences the solar market is through Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs) and Alternative Compliance Payments (ACP).\nThere have been several major policy changes in DC that affect solar adoption incentives, as summarized in this RPS report by the DC Public Service Commission (https://dcpsc.org/Orders-and-Regulations/PSC-Reports-to-the-DC-Council/Renewable-Energy-Portfolio-Standard.aspx) - Distributed Generation Amendment Act, 2011 - Amended RPS to increase solar requirements through 2023 to 2.5%. - Restricted eligible solar energy resources to those within the District or connected to a feeder serving the District."

    "section": "1.1 Introduction",
    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nBuilding decarbonization is a critical component of the multiple transitions needed to combat climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provides unprecedented incentives for households to install home improvements for electrification and energy efficiency, like installing heat pumps instead of fossil-fuel powered heaters and weatherization/insulation (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/climate/tax-breaks-inflation-reduction-act.html)\nThese efforts have been aided by technological advances in the form of fine-grained building-level data, recently available at nationwide scale. One such dataset - developed by BlocPower - uses data on building type and equipment (single -family/multi-family, heating and cooling systems) sourced from tax assessment records. It then uses them as inputs for energy modeling algorithms/software developed by the Department of Energy. Crucially, this allows estimation of counterfactuals, i.e. the reduction in energy usage that would result from targeted retrofits. BlocPower’s own core operation takes building data for a city, uses their proprietary algorithm to estimate the ideal intervention, potential cost of a retrofit, and projected reduction in energy use (it also provides financing options).\nFinance is the key variable in these ambitious transition plans. Many of the new policies provide incentives like tax credits and rebates, instead of direct transfers to finance retrofits. However, it is useful to get an estimate of the total cost required to achieve a specified reduction in energy use and emissions from buildings. (This is also useful where governments are spending money directly to decarbonize their own building portfolios). https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/12/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-first-ever-federal-building-performance-standard-catalyzes-american-innovation-to-lower-energy-costs-save-taxpayer-dollars-and-cut-emissions/\nThe set of possible interventions for each building can consist of:\nWeatherization Energy efficiency retrofits/electrification Rooftop solar Linear programming formulation Despite some differences in these particular interventions, the basic structure requires an upfront cost to be spent on a building, after which its energy usage will go down by some factor (i.e. there will be energy savings). For our current purpose, let weatherization be the only building intervention we consider. We abstract away the exact financing mechanisms included in the IRA and BIL (rebates and incentives), and assume that the local government has a fixed budget to allocate for weatherizing buildings. The objective is to maximize energy savings - or equivalently, reduce emissions - subject to the constraint that the total cost cannot be larger than the budget. For this, we need recommendations of which buildings to target.\nLinear programming is a well-established mathematical tool used for policy purposes, starting from optimizing military logistics during WW2 to optimizing the energy source mixture (see appendix). This problem formulation fits well with a linear programming framework. Specifically, this is an example of a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem, as the solution must be an integer (we can’t weatherize 3.6 buildings).\nRead in geocoded building data (Madisonville, KY)¶\n\n\nCode\n# # # Load data blocpower\n# # zipdf = pd.read_csv(\"Merged_CJEST.csv\")\n\n# # mic = pd.read_csv(\"Microsoft_Building_zip.csv\")\n# # ########################################################################\n\n# # mic['zcta'] = mic['zcta'].astype(str)\n\n# # zipdf['zipcode'] = zipdf['zipcode'].astype(str)\n# # zipdf = zipdf.merge(mic, how='left', left_on='zipcode', right_on='zcta')\n\n# # # Load the shapefile of zipcodes from the US Census Bureau website\n# # tiger_shp_url = 'https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2022/ZCTA520/tl_2022_us_zcta520.zip'\n# # zip_shp = gpd.read_file(tiger_shp_url)\n# # # no state column in 2022 file\n\n\n# # # Rename the ZIP code column to \"zip\" and select the \"zip\" and \"geometry\" columns\n# # zip_shp = zip_shp.rename(columns={\"GEOID\": \"zip_code\",\n# #                                   \"geometry\": \"zip_geom\"})\n# # # zip_shp = zip_shp[['zip_name', 'zip_fips', 'geometry']]\n\n# # zip_shp['zcta_shp'] = zip_shp.ZCTA5CE20.astype(str)\n# # zipdf['zcta_bp'] = zipdf.zipcode.astype(str)\n\n\n# # zip_shp = zip_shp.merge(zipdf, how='left', left_on='zcta_shp', right_on='zcta_bp')\n\n# # zip_shp = zip_shp[~(zip_shp.state_code.isin(['AK', 'HI']))]\n\n# # #zip_shp = gpd.GeoDataFrame(zip_shp, geometry='zip_geom', crs='epsg:4326')\n\n# # zip_shp.to_csv(r'C:\\Users\\HK\\Downloads\\Final_Report\\Final_Report\\cejst_bp_zip_shp.csv')\n\n\n# zipdf = pd.read_csv('cejst_bp_zip_shp.csv')\n\n# zipdf['zip_geom'] = zipdf['zip_geom'].apply(wkt.loads)\n# zipdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(zipdf, geometry = zipdf['zip_geom'], crs='epsg:4326')\n# zipdf = zipdf.round(2)\n\n\n# # Load the shapefile of counties from the US Census Bureau \n# state_url = 'https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2022/STATE/tl_2022_us_state.zip'\n# st_shp = gpd.read_file(state_url)\n# statedf = pd.read_csv('state_shp.csv')\n# st_shp = st_shp.merge(statedf, left_on='STUSPS', right_on='num_state', how='inner')"

So, weatherizing a gas-heated building reduces energy use by 4% and costs 2000 USD.\n\n3.1.7.1 Energy savings factors:\n\nGas Buildings = 0.96\nOil Buildings = 0.98\n\n\n\n3.1.7.2 Cost:\n\nGas buildings = 2000\nOil Buildings = 3000\n\nMultiply the above factors with the cost and energy columns to obtain 2 new columns per building, $e_i$ (energy savings after weatherization) and $c_i$ (cost of weatherization).\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261922010510\nEnergy savings achieved: 61656.41 GJ Cost of intervention: USD 3000000 Buildings weatherized: 1442 Visualize recommendations on map\n\n\nCode\n# gdf = gdf.round(2)\n# # merge to optimized dataframe\n# gdf = gdf.merge(test, left_on='building_id', right_on='building_id', how='inner')\n\n# Convert the DataFrame to a GeoDataFrame\ngdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(test, geometry='geometry', crs='epsg:4326')\n\n# create retrofit column\n# gdf['Retrofit?'] = gdf['opt'].apply(lambda x: 'YES' if x == 1 else 'NO')\n\n#round energy savings column\n# gdf['energy_savings'] = gdf['energy_savings'].round(3)\n\nm1 = gdf.explore(\"energy_use_intensity\", #tooltip=False, #categorical=True, \n                 tooltip=[\"address\", \"area_sq_ft\", \"energy_use_intensity\",\n                        \"building_type\", \"heating_fuel_type\"])\n\n # Set `preferCanvas` to optimize performance of map\nm1.options[\"preferCanvas\"] = True\n\n#set a tile layer - OSM\nfolium.TileLayer(\"OpenStreetMap\").add_to(m1)\nm1\n\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook\n\n\n\n\nCode\nm1.save\n\n\n&lt;bound method Element.save of &lt;folium.folium.Map object at 0x000001CC2DB231C0&gt;&gt;"
